These projects specifications were given to a "Baby Gopher".

> "I am keen to be abreast with what's happening in the **Golang** world. To that end, we will write a command-line program (**`redditnews.go`**) that fetches and displays the latest headlines from the golang page on Reddit.
>
> The program will:
>
> * make an HTTP request to the Reddit API.
> * decode the JSON response into a Go data structure, and
> * display each link's author, score, URL and title.
>
> We will then be building a _bare-bones_ News Reader package (**`redditnews`**) that gives us the latest news and headlines from the Golang Sub-Reddit, using Reddit's API. 
>

The "Baby Gopher" built this package and documented his progress so that other "Baby Gophers" could find it easy to understand the _mechanics_ of writing a package in Go. He/she would now be able to build their own Go packages.
